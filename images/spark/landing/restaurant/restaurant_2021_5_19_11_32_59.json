Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"1-288-751-8509 x07511","address":"Suite 137 72644 Crist Stream, New Lachelle, NE 73231","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"6:52 AM","closes_at":"10:40 PM","is_closed":true},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"7:14 AM","closes_at":"6:29 PM","is_closed":true},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"10:56 AM","closes_at":"6:46 PM","is_closed":true},"thursday":{"opens_at":"11:49 AM","closes_at":"9:28 PM","is_closed":true},"friday":{"opens_at":"6:45 AM","closes_at":"3:16 PM","is_closed":true},"saturday":{"opens_at":"11:49 AM","closes_at":"5:32 PM","is_closed":true},"sunday":{"opens_at":"6:39 AM","closes_at":"5:13 PM","is_closed":true}},"user_id":7263,"dt_current_timestamp":1621423981836},{"id":1474,"uid":"f31d3884-d92e-441a-99e1-3e2c7aa7fc6d","name":"738 Diner","type":"Burgers","description":"To ensure that each guest receives prompt, professional, friendly and courteous service.
