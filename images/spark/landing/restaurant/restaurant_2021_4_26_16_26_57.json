Also the variety of fish in stock wasnt a lot but hopefully that can change over time. The cost justify the quality youre getting. A solid 4 stars.","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"448-269-2624 x2994","address":"601 Harber Lakes, Olenton, WV 20856","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"11:43 AM","closes_at":"7:46 PM","is_closed":true},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"10:46 AM","closes_at":"11:16 PM","is_closed":false},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"6:59 AM","closes_at":"7:43 PM","is_closed":false},"thursday":{"opens_at":"10:26 AM","closes_at":"1:11 PM","is_closed":true},"friday":{"opens_at":"9:19 AM","closes_at":"11:20 PM","is_closed":true},"saturday":{"opens_at":"9:34 AM","closes_at":"1:33 PM","is_closed":true},"sunday":{"opens_at":"7:27 AM","closes_at":"7:16 PM","is_closed":false}},"user_id":7434,"dt_current_timestamp":1619454419535},{"id":5678,"uid":"7ca5e662-7543-4728-8896-8c1f80bc1644","name":"Fast Coffee","type":"Desserts","description":"Culver\u2019s Restaurant was founded by the Culver family in 1984, which eventually branched out to more than 300 franchised restaurants all over the US.

The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"1-187-793-4097 x46313","address":"Suite 414 72299 Ledner Club, Ricardoburgh, ME 76564","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"6:25 AM","closes_at":"8:22 PM","is_closed":true},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"7:21 AM","closes_at":"4:29 PM","is_closed":false},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"6:32 AM","closes_at":"7:33 PM","is_closed":true},"thursday":{"opens_at":"6:48 AM","closes_at":"7:33 PM","is_closed":false},"friday":{"opens_at":"8:41 AM","closes_at":"1:16 PM","is_closed":false},"saturday":{"opens_at":"11:40 AM","closes_at":"1:14 PM","is_closed":false},"sunday":{"opens_at":"10:17 AM","closes_at":"6:42 PM","is_closed":false}},"user_id":3694,"dt_current_timestamp":1619454419535},{"id":6031,"uid":"7609ff26-6179-4907-83de-53dd93262135","name":"Sweet Subs","type":"American (Traditional)","description":"Delhaize Group will achieve leading positions in food retailing in key mature and emerging markets.
