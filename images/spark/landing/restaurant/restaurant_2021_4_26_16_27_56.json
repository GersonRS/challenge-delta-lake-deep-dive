Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"(357) 952-5689 x35294","address":"20762 Okuneva Mountain, Juliustown, MI 56422-5505","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"8:39 AM","closes_at":"1:47 PM","is_closed":false},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"11:15 AM","closes_at":"6:21 PM","is_closed":true},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"8:35 AM","closes_at":"12:12 PM","is_closed":false},"thursday":{"opens_at":"9:57 AM","closes_at":"12:51 PM","is_closed":true},"friday":{"opens_at":"11:50 AM","closes_at":"6:56 PM","is_closed":true},"saturday":{"opens_at":"10:14 AM","closes_at":"3:11 PM","is_closed":true},"sunday":{"opens_at":"11:23 AM","closes_at":"7:59 PM","is_closed":true}},"user_id":8215,"dt_current_timestamp":1619454478465},{"id":657,"uid":"ecb5c800-0b5e-46b9-a202-0771250b964b","name":"Green Grill & Tap","type":"Bakery","description":"We are committed to using the finest ingredients in our recipes.
