No food leaves our kitchen that we ourselves would not eat.","review":"Id have to say that each piece was fresh and had their own slight unique flavor twist to it, pushing the line between traditional edomae and fusion. The Hokkaido uni and the ocean trout topped with cook seaweed was the highlights of the meal. But each piece served was really something special.","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"709-293-7520 x353","address":"393 Schiller Stream, West Claricehaven, MN 98029-4591","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"10:50 AM","closes_at":"10:57 PM","is_closed":false},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"9:33 AM","closes_at":"4:35 PM","is_closed":true},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"10:32 AM","closes_at":"11:58 PM","is_closed":true},"thursday":{"opens_at":"8:46 AM","closes_at":"6:38 PM","is_closed":false},"friday":{"opens_at":"7:29 AM","closes_at":"8:58 PM","is_closed":false},"saturday":{"opens_at":"7:29 AM","closes_at":"5:13 PM","is_closed":true},"sunday":{"opens_at":"6:33 AM","closes_at":"4:30 PM","is_closed":false}},"user_id":7706,"dt_current_timestamp":1619454338618},{"id":6895,"uid":"d0285d49-c326-4fca-b7d4-f5ad86af3ce7","name":"83 Sushi","type":"Brazilian","description":"To deliver an exceptional shopping experience by offering the best service, value, quality, and freshest products while being good stewards of our environment and giving back to the communities we serve.","review":"For dinner we ordered the shrimp enchiladas, chicken enchiladas, chicken burrito, chimichangas, and steak quesadillas. Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"579.442.0242 x351","address":"Suite 257 947 Joey Overpass, New Renayport, WV 68911","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"9:32 AM","closes_at":"3:49 PM","is_closed":false},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"8:12 AM","closes_at":"5:41 PM","is_closed":false},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"6:29 AM","closes_at":"7:30 PM","is_closed":false},"thursday":{"opens_at":"10:14 AM","closes_at":"1:22 PM","is_closed":true},"friday":{"opens_at":"10:16 AM","closes_at":"4:48 PM","is_closed":false},"saturday":{"opens_at":"7:18 AM","closes_at":"12:54 PM","is_closed":false},"sunday":{"opens_at":"10:39 AM","closes_at":"3:41 PM","is_closed":true}},"user_id":9181,"dt_current_timestamp":1619454338618},{"id":1632,"uid":"a0758640-151b-4eb1-91c3-5e6453cf3225","name":"Orange Gastropub","type":"Healthy","description":"Our mission is to be a leader in the distribution and merchandising of food, pharmacy, health and personal care items, seasonal merchandise, and related products and services.
