The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"1-205-162-1457","address":"Apt. 250 40242 McDermott Union, Lannyside, UT 78037-7969","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"9:30 AM","closes_at":"12:20 PM","is_closed":false},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"10:58 AM","closes_at":"7:22 PM","is_closed":false},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"7:22 AM","closes_at":"9:25 PM","is_closed":true},"thursday":{"opens_at":"10:50 AM","closes_at":"8:50 PM","is_closed":true},"friday":{"opens_at":"7:31 AM","closes_at":"7:48 PM","is_closed":false},"saturday":{"opens_at":"6:31 AM","closes_at":"2:46 PM","is_closed":true},"sunday":{"opens_at":"6:54 AM","closes_at":"2:21 PM","is_closed":true}},"user_id":2851,"dt_current_timestamp":1621352178850},{"id":5889,"uid":"783fffdc-3855-4479-ba63-44ee45bdefe4","name":"Blue Burger","type":"Bakery","description":"Our mission has been to help people achieve their health and wellness goals. though weve changed over the years, our values have remained the same.","review":"Ambience was good, service was no nonsense but friendly.","logo":"https:\/\/loremflickr.com\/500\/500\/restaurant","phone_number":"(276) 443-0284","address":"58085 VonRueden Valley, Kochtown, NE 25738-8772","hours":{"monday":{"opens_at":"11:31 AM","closes_at":"9:59 PM","is_closed":true},"tuesday":{"opens_at":"11:11 AM","closes_at":"11:31 PM","is_closed":true},"wednesday":{"opens_at":"9:33 AM","closes_at":"9:46 PM","is_closed":false},"thursday":{"opens_at":"7:59 AM","closes_at":"5:16 PM","is_closed":false},"friday":{"opens_at":"10:48 AM","closes_at":"3:37 PM","is_closed":false},"saturday":{"opens_at":"6:42 AM","closes_at":"11:37 PM","is_closed":false},"sunday":{"opens_at":"9:17 AM","closes_at":"11:44 PM","is_closed":false}},"user_id":1604,"dt_current_timestamp":1621352178850}]
