But her new life is caught in deadlock - Dino finds herself stuck in a destructive loop of temporary jobs, financial trouble and hard partying. A broken arm incidentally leads to a position as a housekeeper in a Norwegian middle-class home. Dino is thrown into a reality very far from her own. During a few sultry summer weeks she ends up the centre of an odd love triangle, an unpredictable struggle for affection as well as dominance. \"Underdog\" is a tender and raw story of privilege and longing, yet at the same time a humorous and unmerciful observation of the shifted power balance between Sweden and Norway - an actuality where Swedes have become the Norwegians' servants.","popularity":"0.746802","production_companies":"[{'name': 'Anagram Films', 'id': 19956}]","production_countries":"[{'iso_3166_1': 'SE', 'name': 'Sweden'}]","release_date":"2014-09-26","revenue":0.0,"status":"Released","title":"Underdog","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4.0,"dt_current_timestamp":1621356159681},{"user_id":1768,"adult":"False","belongs_to_collection":null,"genres":"[{'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 10402, 'name': 'Music'}]","id":"316000","imdb_id":"tt0790770","original_language":"en","original_title":"Miles Ahead","overview":"An exploration of the life and music of Miles Davis.","popularity":"3.989771","production_companies":"[{'name': 'Crescendo Productions', 'id': 3314}, {'name': 'Sobini Films', 'id': 13923}, {'name': 'Bifrost Pictures', 'id': 38284}, {'name': 'Naked City Films', 'id': 72749}]","production_countries":"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]","release_date":"2016-03-20","revenue":3460466.0,"status":"Released","title":"Miles Ahead","vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":74.0,"dt_current_timestamp":1621356159681},{"user_id":6335,"adult":"False","belongs_to_collection":null,"genres":"[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Comedy'}, {'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}]","id":"24664","imdb_id":"tt0215545","original_language":"en","original_title":"Bamboozled","overview":"TV producer Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) becomes frustrated when network brass reject his sitcom idea.
