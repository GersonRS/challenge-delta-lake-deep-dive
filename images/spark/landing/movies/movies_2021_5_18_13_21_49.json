In reality she meets her lover, Jean (Jacques Doniol-Valcroze) at his apartment; after some idle chatter and love-making he tells her a story of the shriveled heads that the Jivaro indians used to give their lovers as tokens of affection but as she shivers in disgust, he gives her a mink instead. How will they hide it from her husband though?","popularity":"0.066343","production_companies":"[]","production_countries":"[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]","release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0.0,"status":"Released","title":"Le coup du berger","vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1.0,"dt_current_timestamp":1621344110429},{"user_id":4471,"adult":"False","belongs_to_collection":"{'id': 135416, 'name': 'Prometheus Collection', 'poster_path': '\/gMjiXB5dhV8nN77xXnhTIhARE7a.jpg', 'backdrop_path': '\/cK83Pq8SJoeSTnLJucr8IWn35KF.jpg'}","genres":"[{'id': 27, 'name': 'Horror'}, {'id': 878, 'name': 'Science Fiction'}, {'id': 53, 'name': 'Thriller'}]","id":"126889","imdb_id":"tt2316204","original_language":"en","original_title":"Alien: Covenant","overview":"Bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, the crew of the colony ship 'Covenant' discovers what is thought to be an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world \u2013 which has its sole inhabitant the 'synthetic', David, survivor of the doomed Prometheus expedition.","popularity":"72.884078","production_companies":"[{'name': 'Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation', 'id': 306}, {'name': 'Scott Free Productions', 'id': 1645}, {'name': 'Brandywine Productions', 'id': 19747}, {'name': 'TSG Entertainment', 'id': 22213}]","production_countries":"[{'iso_3166_1': 'AU', 'name': 'Australia'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'CA', 'name': 'Canada'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'NZ', 'name': 'New Zealand'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]","release_date":"2017-05-09","revenue":232380243.0,"status":"Released","title":"Alien: Covenant","vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":2677.0,"dt_current_timestamp":1621344110429},{"user_id":6050,"adult":"False","belongs_to_collection":null,"genres":"[{'id': 10749, 'name': 'Romance'}, {'id': 35, 'name': 'Comedy'}, {'id': 10402, 'name': 'Music'}]","id":"90980","imdb_id":"tt0040664","original_language":"en","original_title":"On Our Merry Way","overview":"Oliver Pease gets a dose of courage from his wife Martha and tricks the editor of the paper (where he writes lost pet notices) into assigning him the day's roving question.
