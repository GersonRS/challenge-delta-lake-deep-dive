Even our modern military has been accused of these practices in the \"war on terror\" against soldiers and civilians both abroad and at home. With eye-opening footage, revealing interviews, humorous anecdotes, and an array of visual effects, the film categorically explores the alleged usage of subliminals in advertising, music, film, television, anti-theft devices, political propaganda, military psychological operations, and advanced weapons development. Director Jeff Warrick makes it his personal mission to determine if these manipulative tactics have succeeded in \"programming the nation?\" Or, if subliminal messaging belongs in the category of what many consider urban legend.","popularity":"0.117849","production_companies":"[{'name': 'Ignite Productions', 'id': 49990}, {'name': 'Digital Media Factory', 'id': 49991}]","production_countries":"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]","release_date":"2011-08-19","revenue":0.0,"status":"Released","title":"Programming The Nation?","vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2.0,"dt_current_timestamp":1621346159271},{"user_id":39,"adult":"False","belongs_to_collection":null,"genres":"[{'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}]","id":"25626","imdb_id":"tt1438461","original_language":"zh","original_title":"\u5efa\u56fd\u5927\u4e1a","overview":"The Founding of a Republic is a Chinese historical film commissioned by China's film regulator and made by the state-owned China Film Group (CFG) to mark the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
